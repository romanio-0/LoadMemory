# LoadMemory
This is a program for downloading an exe/dll file into memory without the participation of the Windows loader.
It is also possible to get a function from a dll file.

There is a __TestMain.c__ file for use, it implements an example of loading powershell

## Note:

The idea for writing was borrowed.
The code does not always work correctly, some exe/dll files may not load.
